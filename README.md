# Toronto AirBnB Listings Analysis

This repo contains a quick analysis of the Toronto AirBnB listings.

### Requirements

* Python (3.5+)
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn
* XGBoost (optional)
* TPot Regressor (optional - recommended)


### Getting Started

First, you'll have to unzip the required csv files from 'data/toronto-october.zip' and place
all the csv files into the main '/data' folder.

Then run the [Jupyter (iPython) notebook]('/airbnb.ipynb) with the following command:

```
jupyter notebook ./airbnb.ipynb
```

The iPython notebook contains a highlevel walk-through of the code and visualizations
of the data.

If you would like to view the code details, then `lib.py` is what you are looking for.
This file contains the code used in the iPython notebook along with documentation
of the usage of each function.
